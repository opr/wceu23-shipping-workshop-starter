# Build a "Not at Home" Shipping Extension in the WooCommerce Checkout Block

Welcome to WordCamp Europe! Join us in an engaging workshop where we'll guide you through building a practical "Not at Home" shipping extension for the WooCommerce Checkout Block.

## Prerequisites: What You'll Need

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites ready:

- A development environment with a blank WP installation
- WooCommerce plugin installed and activated
- Checkout page with the Checkout block integrated
- Free shipping method added in WooCommerce
- "Cash on Delivery" payment option enabled in WooCommerce settings
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript (React)
- IDE/Code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
- Node or NVM (Node Version Manager) installed

## Before We Start: Preparation Steps

Before diving into the workshop, let's make sure everything is set up properly. Take the following steps:

1. Ensure a free shipping method is enabled.
2. Activate the "Cash on Delivery" payment method.
3. Ensure the Checkout page contains the Checkout block, and that the `[woocommerce_checkout]` shortcode has been removed.

To get your development environment ready, follow these straightforward instructions:

```bash
npm i -D prettier@npm:wp-prettier@2.6.2
composer install
composer run phpcbf
npm start
```

Note: `composer run phpcbf` will show an error, this is OK!
